Embedding Images
----------------
Embedded images are implemented with square brackets, the image indicator of 'img:' and the slug of the image. As an example, an image with the slug of 'pigs' will be input in the text field like this: [img:pigs].

Embedding Links
---------------
Embedded links are implemented with square brackets surrounding the text associated, followed with parentheses including the link and an optional reference name. As an example, a link to wikipedia would look like this: \[Wikipedia\]\(http://en.wikipedia.org/ "Wikipedia"\).
